## Monopole_Paper_Calc_Fig_Script
This repository includes the script and associated files necessary to produce the calculations and figures of the paper: Maj R., Cairns I.H., and Martinovic M.M. (2019) _"Impedance and voltage power spectra of a monopole antenna in a warm plasma - derivation and application to CubeSats"_ 

In order to obtain all calculations and the figures for the paper, download all files and folders in the repository and run:
**Start_Run_Monopole_Response_Paper_Figs_Calc.m**
in Matlab. <br>
This will load all necessary data and create the figures. In order to run all calculations from scratch comment out the 'load()' function runs *load('Monopole_paper_QTN_data2.mat')* and *load('Monopole_paper_ShotNoise_Z_data_updated2.mat')* and uncomment the commands that follow these.
